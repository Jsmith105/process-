					</header>
					<p>The design question is How can I create a more a friendlier design that seems engaging and shows the positives of their organization?
</p>
<p>The ultimate impact that I'm trying to have is to Make people who click on the website feel like they should donate now when I look on the first page?
 </p>
<p>some possible solutions to your problem is what would help with making the website seem friendlier and caring is adding picture of patents that are happy. Right now, the website only has one picture of the organization interacting with people. Another problem with the website is the information bar. The menu bar compared to the rest of the website design doesnâ€™t
 </p>
<p>the context and constraints that that i will possibly be facing is the constraints that I might run into is finding an interesting way to get the viewer to read the information.
 </p>
<p>After looking through the website I think my original question needs to answer the question whether I can make the website user friendly. Right now, the website works but at times it fells very wordy.
