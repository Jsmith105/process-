						<p> Trish told me that the primary purpose of the website was to show their services and a place to donate money. The website should also include that their services are for everyone that is a resident in Spartanburg and Cherokee counties. I also asked what separates the cancer associations with its competitors, and she said that all the money donated stays in the community. The users who visit the site range from family members loved ones, and people affected by cancer. I asked Trish how they get their volunteers; she pointed out that their organization receives all of its volunteers form facebook and not the websites. </p>

						<sub><h2>Karen, website user</h2></sub>

						<p>Karen is a cancer patient who told me that she heard about the website form one of her friends who previously diagnosed with cancer. The first thing she did was to go on the website to find more information about what they do. She ran into the problem of the information not being easy to find because there was too much information. </p>

						<sub><h2>Goals of the website</h2></sub>
						<p>After hearing from both the users and the employees, it's clear what needs to change on the websites. The websites need to focus on getting the point across in their services. This means paraphrasing information that runs on, adding hierarchy in the text to give a sense of importance in the information.</p>
