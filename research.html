						<sub>competitors of the Cancer Association of Spartanburg & Cherokee Counties.</sub>
						<p>The competitors are called The 'Children's Cancer partners' of the Carolinas. The website is very well organized and has a friendly design approach. The site even tells the stories of the kids who survive cancer, giving a hopefulness to the organizations brand. The message of the organization on the website is unmistakable compared to the Cancer Associations. Children's Cancer partners simply state that they are helping patents on a journey. Even though this is a small detail, it makes all the difference when knowing what services you are looking for. Although the design choice is mainly towards families with kids suffering from cancer. I think the use of imagery and short sentences makes the wedsite less overwhelming than the one you see on the website for Cancer Association.</p>

								<sub>Innovations in cancer research</sub>
								<p>The difficulty with treating cancers is each patient will be treated accordingly to their specific disease. The new method helps the immune system identify in attacking tumors, a field known as immuno-oncology. BioNTech is developing therapeutic vaccines that are created for each cancer.
The vaccines are given in the form of messenger RNA. RNA is a molecule that provides cells with instructions to create a particular protein. CRISPR/Cas9 has changed the field of gene editing by making it much simpler and faster to modify DNA sequences with high precision. The technology could also change the field of oncology, as it could be used to improve cancer therapies such as CAR-T which is not fully understood.</p>
								<p>Even though Cancer Association of Spartanburg & Cherokee Counties is not in the business of finding cures to cancer. I think it is important for the organization to reconized these new studys and use them as a way to give their patients hope and to show how cerent they are in the metical work making them look prafessnal.Even though the Cancer Association of Spartanburg & Cherokee Counties is not in the business of finding cures to cancer.
