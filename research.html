				<h3>compeditors of the Cancer Association of Spartanburg & Cherokee Counties</h3>
				<p>The competitors is called The 'Children's Cancer partners' of the carolinas. The website is very well organized and has a friendly design approtch. The website even tells the stories of the kids who survies cancer giving a hopfulness to the organizations brand. The message of the organization on the website is clear compared to the Cancer Associations. Children's Cancer partners simply states that they are helping patents on a journey. Even through this is a small detail it makes all the differents when knowing what services you are looking for. Although the design chouce is mainly towards familys with kids suffering from cancer. I think the use of imagery and short sentances makes the wedsite less overwlming than the one you see on the website for Cancer Association.</p>

				<h2>Inovations in cancer research</h2>
					<p>The difficulty with treating cancers is each patient will be treated accordingly to their specific disease. The new method helps the immune system identify in attacking tumors, a field known as immuno-oncology. BioNTech is developing therapeutic vaccines that are created for each cancer.
The vaccines are given in the form of messenger RNA. RNA is a molecule that provides cells with instructions to create a particular protein. CRISPR/Cas9 has changed the field of gene editing by making it much simpler and faster to modify DNA sequences with high precision. The technology could also change the field of oncology, as it could be used to improve cancer therapies such as CAR-T which is not fully understood.
